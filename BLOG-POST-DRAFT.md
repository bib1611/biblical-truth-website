# Why Most Christian Men Are Failing (And How to Fix It)

Look, I'm not here to make you feel good.

Most Christian men today are soft. Not physically (though that's often true too), but spiritually and mentally. They've been fed a watered-down version of Christianity that would make the apostles sick.

You know what I'm talking about. The "Jesus is my homeboy" Christianity. The "God wants you comfortable" Christianity. The "don't offend anyone" Christianity.

It's garbage.

## Here's the Uncomfortable Truth

The Bible doesn't call you to be comfortable. It calls you to be a warrior.

Not in some metaphorical, safe-space kind of way. A real warrior. Someone who fights against sin,leads his family with authority, and doesn't bend when the culture tells him to.

But most churches won't tell you this. They're too busy trying to be "relevant" and fill seats.

## What Biblical Masculinity Actually Looks Like

Let me be clear: Biblical masculinity isn't about being a jerk. It's not about dominating your wife or yelling at your kids.

It's about:
- **Leadership** - Taking responsibility instead of making excuses
- **Sacrifice** - Putting your family's spiritual health above your comfort
- **Courage** - Standing for truth even when everyone thinks you're crazy
- **Discipline** - Controlling your body and mind instead of letting them control you

Sound hard? Good. It's supposed to be.

## The Marriage Problem

Here's something nobody wants to talk about: Most Christian marriages are a joke.

Not because of "communication issues" or "love languages" (though those self-help books will gladly take your money).

Because the husband isn't leading. He's passive. He's let his wife become the spiritual leader, the decision-maker, the one who actually cares about the Bible.

And then everyone wonders why the marriage is falling apart.

Your wife doesn't need another girlfriend. She needs a leader. A man who knows what he believes and isn't afraid to live it out.

## The Porn Epidemic Nobody Mentions

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: sexual sin specifically, pornography.

If you're a Christian man struggling with porn, you're not alone. Stats say 60-70% of Christian men admit to watching it regularly.

But here's the thing: your pastor isn't going to help you. Most churches either ignore it or give you some weak accountability group where you sit in a circle and feel bad together.

That doesn't work. You need to understand what porn is actually doing to your brain, your marriage, and your walk with God. And you need practical steps to kill it.

Not "try harder." Not "pray more." Actual tactics.

## What You Need to Do Right Now

Stop waiting for someone to give you permission to be a biblical man.

Your pastor isn't coming to rescue you. Your small group leader isn't going to suddenly start teaching real truth. The culture certainly isn't going to encourage you.

You have to take responsibility for your own spiritual growth.

That means:
1. **Get in the Word** - Actually study the Bible, not just read devotionals
2. **Find real brothers** - Men who will call you out, not coddlers
3. **Lead your family** - Even if it's uncomfortable
4. **Kill sin** - Aggressively, without excuses

## The Real Jesus

Before I close, let me say this: The Jesus most churches preach isn't the Jesus of the Bible.

The real Jesus called people out. He flipped tables. He told uncomfortable truths that made people want to kill Him.

He didn't die on a cross so you could live a safe, comfortable, middle-class American life.

He died so you could be transformed into a warrior for truth.

That's the Christianity I'm offering. Not the sanitized version. The real thing.

## Join the Fight

This isn't for everyone. If you want comfortable Christianity, there are 10,000 churches that will give it to you.

But if you're done being weak, if you're ready to actually follow the Bible instead of cultural Christianity, then welcome.

12,000+ men have already joined the War Room. We're not here to play games.

$3 gets you lifetime access to everything: 24/7 Bible radio, tactical guides for fathers and warriors, and a community that won't coddle you.

Or don't. Stay comfortable. Stay weak. Stay the same.

Your choice.
