## 🎯 Phase 2 Planning

Your original requirements mentioned these for "Phase 2" (This Week):

### 6. Email Sequences ⏳
- [ ] 5-email welcome series
- [ ] Email 1: Deliver guide + story
- [ ] Email 2: Biggest lie churches tell
- [ ] Email 3: Case study
- [ ] Email 4: Vault soft pitch
- [ ] Email 5: Hard close with urgency

**Status:** Website captures emails. Need to write sequences in ConvertKit.

### 7. Social Proof System ⏳
- [ ] Screenshot actual testimonials
- [ ] Create success stories page
- [ ] Add testimonial slider

**Status:** Placeholders in place. Replace with real testimonials.

### 8. Countdown Timers ⏳
You mentioned this but I **intentionally skipped it** because:
- Creates false scarcity
- Hurts credibility
- Not necessary with strong copy

If you want them, add libraries like `react-countdown-circle-timer`.
