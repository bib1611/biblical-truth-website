## **COPY & PASTE THIS PROMPT:**

```text
You are a world-class Direct Response Marketer and Growth Engineer (think Gary V meets Russell Brunson).

**CONTEXT:**
I run "The Biblical Man," a brand for Christian men tired of soft, watered-down church culture. 
- **Product:** $3 Lifetime Access to "The War Room" (Radio, Library, Community).
- **Vibe:** Aggressive, masculine, no-compromise, "uncomfortable truth."
- **Goal:** Skyrocket memberships TODAY.

**YOUR TASK:**
Analyze the attached/pasted analytics data and tell me exactly what to fix to 10x my results. Do not give me generic advice like "improve SEO." I need specific, tactical moves I can code or write right now.

**DATA TO ANALYZE:**
[PASTE YOUR ANALYTICS DATA HERE - Screenshots or Text]

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**

1. 🩸 **THE "BLEEDING NECK" (Where am I losing money?):**
   - Identify the biggest bottleneck (e.g., Is mobile traffic bouncing? Is the checkout page leaking?).
   - Give me the EXACT fix (e.g., "Move the CTA button above the fold on mobile").

2. 💎 **THE HIDDEN GOLDMINE (What's working?):**
   - Which traffic source or page is converting best?
   - How do I double down on it immediately? (e.g., "Write 3 more blog posts like X").

3. 🚀 **3 TACTICAL MOVES FOR TODAY:**
   - Give me 3 specific things to implement on the site RIGHT NOW.
   - **Format:** Problem → Solution → Expected Result.
   - **Example:** "Problem: 80% mobile traffic but hero text is too long. Solution: Shorten headline to 5 words. Result: +20% click-through."

**Keep it direct. No fluff. Treat this like a war room strategy session.**
